# XRR-Niobium-Uniformity
X-Ray reflectivity using five samples of niobium to visualise and assess uniformity. The data is processed and cleaned and then a Savitzky-Golay filter is used to smooth the data. (polynomial order 2). The main steps of this code include:reading the data, cleaning the data and removing invalid values, applying the filtr to smooth values and then plotting the five datasets in order to visualy compare. Requires Python 3.9, NumPY, MatPlotLib and SciPy
